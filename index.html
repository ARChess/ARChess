        <h3>Welcome.</h3>

        <img src='images/logo.png' height="200" width="200" style="float:right;"/>
		<p>ARC (Augmented Reality Chess) is an experimental project to create a game of chess in an augmented reality.  Why?  Well, for starters, we needed a project for our class, but that isn't the only reason.  Think of the cool side effects of virtualizing the game of chess.  You could receive feedback on the game your playing as your playing it.  You could also be alerted to illegal moves or check/mate.  Finally, you can play a game of chess anywhere that you have a data connection, yet it feels like your playing on an authentic board.  This should not only serve to help make chess easier to learn but also make chess more fun and interactive drawing in a new generation of players.</p>

		<h3>Awesome, Now What?</h3>

		<p>ARC is still in development, but that doesn't mean you can't check it out in the mean time.  You'll need a Windows Phone, in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsphone/develop/ff769508(v=vs.92).aspx">development mode</a>, running at least 7.1 and a computer with <a href="http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/downloadsdk">Visual Studio 2010 Express</a> installed.  Download a copy of the source using the links at the top of the page and run the solution file inside the download.</p>

		<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

		<p>ARC is a collaboration between the minds of <a href="https://github.com/bulletshot60" class="user-mention">@bulletshot60</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jgestring" class="user-mention">@jgestring</a> in partial fulfillment of the requirements of Clemson University CPSC 611: Virtual Reality Systems Fall 2012.</p>

		<h3>Support or Contact</h3>
		
		<p>ARC is still in the early experimental phases, meaning we will only offer limited support.  If you run into a bug, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ARChess/ARChess/issues">report it</a>.  We'll fix the bug in the next release.</p>
